<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are looking to add fullness to your hair, you may have come across hair toppers. But what exactly are they? Are they the same as a full cap wig? Or hair extensions? If not, what makes them different? And how do you even select one in the first place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We at Superhairpieces have created this guide to explain what they are and everything else you will need to know about them as a potential hair replacement system for your needs.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What are hair toppers?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Hair toppers for women" href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/hair-toppers-wigs-for-women/" target="_blank">Hair toppers</a> &mdash; also referred to as &ldquo;wiglets&rdquo; or &ldquo;half wigs&rdquo; &mdash; are a smaller kind of hair system designed to hide hair loss in certain areas of the scalp compared to a wig which covers the full area.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlike hair extensions which are applied to the back side of the scalp or hairline area, hair toppers are applied on the areas on the top of the head as indicated by their name.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who wears hair toppers and why do people wear hair toppers?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like hair extensions, hair toppers are mostly worn by women with the male equivalent being the toupee. But why do they wear them in the first place?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hair toppers instantly cover bald or largely thinning spots on the top of a woman's head while they are also beneficial for adding additional thickness and density as well. This is particularly ideal for women who are dealing with female pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so, if they are styled and applied correctly, toppers can blend with a woman&rsquo;s natural hair giving them the appearance of a natural, full head of hair. In the process, women will feel more confident and beautiful about their appearances.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hair toppers - before and after</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is an example of how your look can dramatically change with the use of a hair topper.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to select a hair topper</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Toppers come in various sizes and lengths depending on the wearer&rsquo;s preferences with the most popular sizes being between 5x7 and 7x9 while the most popular length is 14 inches. So how do you select one?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Here are four key steps:</strong></h3>
<center><img src="https://www.superhairpieces.com/product_images/uploaded_images/female-pattern-hair-loss.jpg" alt="female pattern hair loss" width="50%" /></center>
<p><strong>#1 Determine what stage of hair loss you are at (beginning, progressive, advanced stage)</strong>. The more hair loss you have, the bigger the topper you will require.</p>

<p><strong>#2 Measure the area of your hair loss</strong> as well as your head size from front to back and side to side the area. You will then know whether the hair topper you eventually purchase is ideal for you in terms of a fit.</p>

<p><strong>#3 Choose a base type (monofilament, French lace etc.)</strong> that is suitable for you depending on the hair loss area, required durability and other factors.</p>

<p><strong>#4 Select the hair type (regular Remy human hair and premium Remy human hair)</strong>, hair length &amp; colour. Note that some bases have specific lengths of hair while premium Remy hair is a better option if you plan on wearing a hair topper for the long term.</p>
