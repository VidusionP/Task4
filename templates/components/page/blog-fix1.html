<p style="text-align: justify;">Want to change your look? Today, women can <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/human-hair-wigs-for-women/" target="_blank">buy human hair wigs</a> to completely transform their appearances. A wig can provide a different length of hair, a different hairstyle and even a different hair color.</p>
<p>But while it&rsquo;s possible to go from brunette to blonde without chemically damaging your hair, it&rsquo;s not always advisable to choose any color that you please when buying a wig. That&rsquo;s because it won&rsquo;t always look natural, especially if you&rsquo;re going for a drastic change lighter or darker than your natural hair color.</p>
<p>Choosing the right color can be a challenge even if you&rsquo;re looking for something close to your natural hair color. So with that said, here&rsquo;s a guide on how to <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/hair-wigs-by-color/" target="_blank">choose the right wig color</a> for your hair system.</p>
<h2><strong>Choosing shades lighter or darker than your natural hair</strong></h2>

<p>A general best practice is to choose a color that is close to your natural hair if it&rsquo;s not the exact same color. However, if you are going for something that is a much lighter or darker shade, it can look very dramatic and in some cases, very obvious that you are wearing a wig.</p>
<p>That is why it is best to go a maximum of two shades darker or lighter than your natural color. If you absolutely want to go for a different shade of hair color, one option is to gradually make the transition shade-to-shade rather than going right from light <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/blonde-hair-wigs/" target="_blank">blonde hair</a> to ash blonde for example.</p>
<h2><strong>Match your skin tone</strong></h2>
<p><center><img src="https://www.superhairpieces.com/product_images/uploaded_images/skin-tone.jpg" alt="skin tone" width="50%" /></center></p>
<p>If you are going for a different color for your wig, it&rsquo;s important to consider your skin tone. That&rsquo;s because the wrong color that doesn&rsquo;t match with your skin can lead to unnecessary attention and questions about whether you&rsquo;re wearing a hairpiece.</p>
<p>There are two main skin tones to consider &mdash; cool tones and warm tones. "Cool-toned skin has blue and olive undertones while warm-toned skin has yellow and gold," Rachel Bodt, senior colorist at Red Door Spa in New York City was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>One way to determine if you have cool or warm-toned skin is to check your veins. If your veins are more blue or purple, it is likely that you have cool-toned skin. If your veins are more green, it&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;re more warm-toned. If you see a mixture of both, you are neutral.</p>
<p>And while it can vary depending on the undertones, cool-toned skin tones usually work well with warm colors that are described as &ldquo;honey&rdquo; with examples being golden blonde or orangey red. With warm tones, colors such as ash blonde and brown work.</p>
<h2><strong>Eye color is important as well</strong></h2>
<p><center><img src="https://www.superhairpieces.com/product_images/uploaded_images/eye-color.jpg" alt="match with your eye color" width="50%" /></center></p>
<p>Similar to skin tone, eye color is also a major factor one can consider when choosing their wig color.</p>
<p>For those who have light eye colors such as an orangey-brown, <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/black-hair-wigs/" target="_blank">black hair</a> usually serves well while those with dark brown eyes work well with blonde hair. Green and blue eyes tend to pop when matched with <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/brown-hair-wigs/" target="_blank">brown hair</a> that has red undertones. For the best results, it&rsquo;s worth doing research into wig colors that match both your eyes and your skin tone.</p>
<h2><strong>Consider your age</strong></h2>
<p><center><img src="https://www.superhairpieces.com/product_images/uploaded_images/age.jpg" alt="Consider your age" width="50%" /></center></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a natural fact &mdash; the older you get, the more your skin will turn pale.</p>
<p>That is why it is best to opt for a lighter shade rather than a darker shade color. Ironically enough, grey or light grey works much better than black hair for example, as it helps provide a more natural and flattering look for paler skin tones. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to go for a full grey look even if your goal is to look younger!</p>
<h2><strong>The climate can affect your hair</strong></h2>
<p><center><img src="https://www.superhairpieces.com/product_images/uploaded_images/climate.jpg" alt="climate can affect your hair" width="50%" /></center></p>
<p>Live in a hot area with plenty of sun? This can affect your wig as too much sun exposure can contribute to your hair color fading due to UV rays breaking down the chemical bonds in dyed hair.</p>
<p>In this case, it&rsquo;s best to get a lighter shade of your desired hair color which will fade less quickly compared to darker hair.</p>
<h3><strong>Hair Color Chart: Understanding Colors</strong></h3>
<p>You can find all the colors Superhairpieces offers in our hair system <a href="https://www.superhairpieces.com/hair-color-chart-for-womens-hair-system" target="_blank">hair color chart for women</a>.</p>
<p>While you can always look at the chart to determine which color is which, it&rsquo;s also helpful to understand our color system as not every hair system manufacturer will have the same one. Essentially, the lower the number in a particular range, the darker the shade will be.</p>
<p>You can also order a color ring to see exactly how the color looks in real life as there can be a discrepancy between images posted on our website.</p>
